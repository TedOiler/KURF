Research Plan


Research: ~ 35%
Coding: ~ 50%
Documentation: ~ 15%


1. Research (52.5 hours ~ 35%):
    * Review current literature on Bayesian Optimization, with a focus on the use of past data and local vs global optimization (17 hours ~ 32%)
    * Deep dive into algorithmic approaches to optimize initial sampling, examining various adaptive strategies (17 hours ~ 32%)
    * Explore the practical implications and applications of this project in machine learning and chemical engineering (12.5 hours ~ 25%)
    * Investigate the concept of entropy as it pertains to the information contained in the initial sample (6 hours ~ 11%)
2. Coding and Results (75 hours ~ 50%):
    * Development of the codebase for Bayesian Optimization (20 hours ~ 27%)
    * Collaborate with the Mathematics student to develop an entropy calculation for the initial sample (5 hours ~ 7%)
    * Design and execution of experiments, which now includes experimenting with different initial samples and studying their impact on BO convergence (25 hours ~ 33%)
    * Data analysis, visualization, and interpreting results (25 hours ~ 33%)
3. Documentation (22.5 hours ~ 15%):
    * Write an informal report summarising the process, methodologies, and learnings (12.5 hours ~ 55%).
    * Document the code, explaining the purpose and function of each module, function, etc., and how to use and extend it (10 hours ~ 45%)
